        <h2>Nathan Luke</h2>
        <h2>CIT Major</h2>

        <p>Hi, I am Nathan. Despite being a student here at BYUI for some time now, I'm still fairly new to the CIT major. COVID and online classes have slowed me down but I am very hopeful to play some catchup this year! The career path I am looking at right now is database administration, though that is certainly subject to change.</p>

        <p>As for some hobbies, I am really badly wanting to play tennis! So if any of you are down to play (I have extra rackets) please let me know! I'm trying to get a bit of a group going and its slow going so far. All of this, of course, depends on this sad weather clearing up. I'm also into retro gaming including learning the history behind each aspect of it, although time has not been on my side to pursue this particular hobby as of late.</p>

        <p>I'll finish with a favorite scripture - Ether 12:6</p>

        <article>And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.</article>

        <p>There's a lot one can pull from this scripture, but a main simple takeaway for me is to just not give up. Stick with it! That could apply to faith, school, personal goals, and so on.</p>
